# Six (LS)
Bring back the iOS 6 Lock Screen to iOS 11 - 14. The original tweak is on https://skitty.xyz/repo/


## Roothide version
A note from aehmttw:

I've updated this tweak to use the correct paths on Roothide so that assets are no longer missing. I had to remove notification support though because I ran into compile errors - I might revisit that at a later point. 

Check out the GitHub releases for a deb file.
